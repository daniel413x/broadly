/*

when generating static build pages during the Next.js build process, the following ambiguous error can occur:

Error occurred prerendering page "/library". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error
Error: redacted
    at /app/.next/server/chunks/6661.js:1:17303
Export encountered an error on /(app)/(library)/library/page: /library, exiting the build.
 тип Next.js build worker exited with code: 1 and signal: null
error: script "build" exited with code 1

this happens because the build time does not have the proper context in the form of a session

thus, the solution is to force dynamic rendering for this page

it is worth looking into making a static build possible by changing the procedures chain (init.ts and the procedures.ts files) to return non-error objects
